# Coding Plans

## Design and Scope Constraints

- Explore any existing design systems and understand it deeply.
- Implement EXACTLY and ONLY what the user requests.
- No extra features, no added components, no UX embellishments.
- Style aligned to the design system at hand.
- Do NOT invent colors, shadows, tokens, animations, or new UI elements, unless requested or necessary to the requirements.
- If any instruction is ambiguous, choose the simplest valid interpretation.
